# Qasir React Boilerplate

Qasir's Frontend Mitra (ReactJS Seed) has been designed to provide you with a super fast test driven front-end development lifecycle. Everything you need should be just one command away.


### Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Node installed. We also recommend you install Yarn as well.

```
You have to be on Node >= 8.x and Yarn >= 1.5. 
```
2. Run the installation script.

```
yarn install
```
3. Running the example website, from within the root directory run the local web server using.

```
yarn dev
yarn serve:dev
```
4. Load the example site at [http://localhost:3000/#/welcome](http://localhost:3000/#/welcome) if it did not already open automatically. If port 3000 has already been taken, another port will be used. Look at the console messages to see which.
