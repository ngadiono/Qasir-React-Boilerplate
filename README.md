## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Inside there are 2 code styles, Javascript and Typescript. Each there are 3 variants : Landing, dashboard and mobile.

## Quick start

1.  Ensure you have the latest version of Node installed. We also recommend you install Yarn as well.

    ```
    You have to be on Node >= 8.x, Yarn or NPM.
    ```

2.  Download code and change name directory root.

    **Javascript code**

    Landing

    ```
    npm init next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/js/landing"
    ```

    ```
    yarn create next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/js/landing"
    ```

    Dashboard

    ```
    npm init next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/js/dashboard"
    ```

    ```
    yarn create next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/js/dashboard"
    ```

    Mobile

    ```
    npm init next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/js/mobile"
    ```

    ```
    yarn create next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/js/mobile"
    ```

    **Typescript code**

    Landing

    ```
    npm init next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/ts/landing"
    ```

    ```
    yarn create next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/ts/landing"
    ```

    Dashboard

    ```
    npm init next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/ts/dashboard"
    ```

    ```
    yarn create next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/ts/dashboard"
    ```

    Mobile

    ```
    npm init next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/ts/mobile"
    ```

    ```
    yarn create next-app project-name --example "https://github.com/qasir-id/Qasir-React-Boilerplate/tree/master/ts/mobile"
    ```

3.  You now have a new directory called `project-name`. Let’s `cd` into it:

    ```
    cd project-name
    ```

4.  Run the installation script.

    ```
    npm run install
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  Load the example site at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it did not already open automatically. If port 3000 has already been taken, another port will be used. Look at the console messages to see which.
